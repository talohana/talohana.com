## Introduction

There are many tools today that makes you really productive, they take away fixing small errors and formatting your code.

In this tutorial we are going to build a TypeScript project from scratch, add it linting and formatting capabilities
and at the end making it automatic with every `git commit` you run.

<br />

## Creating a TypeScript Project

We are going to create the simplest TypeScript project. In Order to do so, run the following commands

```shell
mkdir typescript-example
cd $_
npm init -y
npm i -D typescript
npx tsc --init
```

## Adding ESLint

First, let's understand what ESLint is all about, from [eslint getting-started](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

> ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in
> ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

Pretty straight forward, it's something you really want in your project.
To add ESLint we'll need to add the following packages

```shell
npm i -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

and add two files to our project folder:
A file named `.eslintrc.js` which contains all our ESLint configurations

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
  plugins: ['@typescript-eslint'],
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
  ],
};
```

You can explore the recommended rules for
[eslint:recommended](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin)
and for
[@typescript-eslint/recommended](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

A File named .eslintignore so we won't compile node_modules

```js
// .eslintignore
node_modules;
```

PS, add your compiled code folder here or any other folder you wish to ignore

Final thing, let's add two npm scripts that lint and fix the code for us

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx",
  "lint:fix": "npm run lint -- --fix"
}
```

In order to test the scripts, add a dummy `index.ts` file with the following content

```ts
const x: number = 123;

console.log(x);
```

We can see that the type annotation is redundant and can be omitted, after running  
`npm run tslint:fix` the file is linted and fixed for us

```ts
const x = 123;

console.log(x);
```

## Adding Prettier

So what is Prettier? from [Prettier Docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)

> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter
> It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

Long story short, you won't have to argue about tabs vs spaces (or any other code-style) ever again!

To add Prettier and integrate it with ESLint add the following packages:

```shell
npm i -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

Next, we'll update `.eslintrc.js` to ignore all formatting rules that are not from Prettier, and then use Prettier as an ESLint rule

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
  plugins: ['@typescript-eslint', 'prettier'],
  rules: {
    'prettier/prettier': 'error',
  },
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:prettier/recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
  ],
};
```

In order to test this, let's create a simple `.prettierrc` file that contains our [Prettier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)

```js
// .prettierrc
{
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

Back to our `index.ts` let's add some unformatted code

```ts
const x: string = 'Unformatted String';

console.log(x);
```

after running `npm run tslint:fix` we can see the fixed and formatted file

```ts
const x = 'Unformatted String';

console.log(x);
```

## Adding lint-staged and husky

It's pretty easy to forget linting and formatting our code before comitting and pushing it, [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to the rescue!

Husky is a package that helps us integrate with [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) and lint-staged is helping us to lint our staged files.

First, let's initialize git by running `git init` and creating `.gitingore` file

```js
// .gitignore
node_modules;
```

Let's add them by running

```shell
npm i -D husky lint-staged
```

and add their configuration to our `package.json`

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": "eslint --cache --fix"
  }
}
```

That's all! now when we `git commit` our files we'll get linting and formatting automatically.
