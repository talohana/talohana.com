# Woah, an entire page about me!

<br />

## Hi! I'm Tal :wave:

I'm a software engineer. I was born in 1997 and grew up in Israel.

I'm coding since 2016 in a wide range of languages and technologies. <br />
I'm most interested in web technologies, my current stack consists of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Gatsby, Angular and more.

In 2020 I graduated from the [College of Management](https://english.colman.ac.il/) with Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I love reading [and writing](/blog) about programming, hoping to spread my ideas and best practices. <br />
I'm an OSS enthusiast, always trying to contribute back to the community and making my projects open source.

When I'm not coding and pushing pixels around, I enjoy sports, reading and juggling, my current goal is juggling with 5 balls :juggling:
