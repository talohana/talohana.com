# Wooah, entire page about me!

<br />

## Hi! I'm Tal :wave:

I'm a software engineer. I was born in 1997 and grew up in Israel.

I'm coding since 2016 in wide range of languages and technologies.
I'm most interested in web technologies, my current stack consists of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Gatsby, Angular and many more.

I love reading [and writing](/blog) about programming, hoping to spread my ideas and best practices.
I'm an OSS enthusiast, always trying to contribute back to the community and making my projects open source - [including this site!](/TODO:).

When I'm not coding and pushing pixels around, I enjoy sport and juggling with current goal of juggling with 5 balls :juggling:
