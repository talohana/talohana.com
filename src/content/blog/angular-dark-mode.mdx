Recently, I launched my minimal portfolio (the one you are in right now!)

Using React and Gatsby, I have a ton of options to choose from, but I stumbled upon a minimal yet powerful library called [use-dark-mode](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode).
Ten minutes later, I already had dark mode integrated into my portfolio!

As an Angular developer, I thought it would be nice to have such a library in our ecosystem as well, so I created angular-dark-mode!

> Final code and demo available in [this stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dark-mode-blog-example?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts).

## Setup

First, let's quickly create an angular project we can play with by running:

```shell
npx @angular/cli new dark-mode-playground --minimal
```

Next, add angular-dark-mode:

```shell
npm i angular-dark-mode
```

Or if you prefer yarn:

```shell
yarn add angular-dark-mode
```

Lastly, add the angular-dark-mode.js file to the angular.json scripts section:

```json
{
  "scripts": ["./node_modules/angular-dark-mode/angular-dark-mode.js"]
}
```

For more on `angular-dark-mode.js`, see below.

## Show Me the Code

angular-dark-mode ships with some configurable options:

| Option          |                         Description                          |            Default Value |
| --------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------: | -----------------------: |
| darkModeClass   |                   dark mode css class name                   |            `'dark-mode'` |
| lightModeClass  |                  light mode css class name                   |           `'light-mode'` |
| preloadingClass | css class name to flag that `element` is in preloading state | `'dark-mode-preloading'` |
| storageKey      |            localStorage key to persist dark mode             |            `'dark-mode'` |
| element         |         target HTMLElement to set given css classes          |          `document.body` |

Given the default options, let's add some styling to reflect our dark and light modes:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
}

body:not(.dark-mode-preloading) {
  transition: all 0.3s linear;
}

body.dark-mode {
  background-color: #2f3542;
  color: #f1f2f6;
}

body.light-mode {
  background-color: #f1f2f6;
  color: #2f3542;
}
```

We want to set styles based on the default configuration above, so we set the styles of dark-mode and light-mode CSS classes.

Also, we want a nice transition between the modes but want to skip the initial transition, so we set it after the preloading phase.

Moving on to `app.component.ts`, inject `DarkModeService` and add some text as well as a toggle button:

```ts:app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DarkModeService } from 'angular-dark-mode';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <h1>angular-dark-mode is Awesome!</h1>
    <p>Toggle the checkbox to see magic happens!</p>
    <div>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        [checked]="darkMode$ | async"
        (change)="onToggle()"
      />
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [
    `
      :host {
        min-height: 100vh;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
      }
    `,
  ],
})
export class AppComponent {
  darkMode$: Observable<boolean> = this.darkModeService.darkMode$;

  constructor(private darkModeService: DarkModeService) {}

  onToggle(): void {
    this.darkModeService.toggle();
  }
}
```

All set! Run the application, and depending on your OS theme, it will open in dark or light mode:

<Image
  src="/assets/blog/angular-dark-mode/example.gif"
  alt="angular-dark-mode example"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

## angular-dark-mode.js

This file has a few purposes:

1. Persistence — angular-dark-mode saves your preference in `localStorage`.
   When the app loads, it retrieves the latest value from `localStorage` or falls back to the OS’s preference.

2. Preloading — As we saw, the preloadingClass option can be quite handy when we want to skip the initial transition,
   so we set the `preloadingClass` in this file and remove it after initialization.

> The angular-dark-mode.js file shipped with the library assumes you are using default options.
> If you override them, be sure to copy angular-dark-mode.js locally, make the necessary changes,
> and load the local file in angular.json instead of the library one.
