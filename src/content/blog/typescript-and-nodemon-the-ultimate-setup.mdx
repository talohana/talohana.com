Setting up TypeScript and Nodemon can sometimes get tricky, in this article I am going to show you how to setup TypeScript and Nodemon with ease!

Find the full source code of this article in [this github repository](https://github.com/talohana/typescript-nodemon-ultimate-setup)

## Create a Sample Project

Let’s start by creating a sample project, we’ll do this by running:

```shell
mkdir typescript-nodemon-ultimate-setup
```

Next, create minimal npm packge by running:

```shell
npm init -y or yarn init -y
```

> Note: to reduce verbosity, for the rest of the article i’m going to use npm and omit yarn commands

Add the required dependencies:

```shell
npm i -D typescript ts-node nodemon @types/node
```

Initialize TypeScript by running `npx tsc --init`

Lastly, we need some source code to work with, so let’s create src/index.ts file containing the following TypeScript:

```ts
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log('Hello', name);
}

const readerName = 'Medium Reader';

greet(readerName);
```

## Adding Nodemon

Nodemon can be configured in [various ways](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#config-files),
I am going to configure it with a json file by adding `nodemon.json` in our project root folder:

```json
{
  "restartable": "rs",
  "ignore": [".git", "node_modules/", "dist/", "coverage/"],
  "watch": ["src/"],
  "execMap": {
    "ts": "node -r ts-node/register"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development"
  },
  "ext": "js,json,ts"
}
```

Let’s go over the configuration:

- restartable — a command we can use to restart the program manually
- ignore — list of files we don’t want to trigger a program restart when changing
- watch — list of paths we do want to trigger a program restart when changing
- execMap — a mapping between a file type/extension to a runtime
- env — environment variables to include
- ext — the file extensions Nodemon monitores

In order to run and debug our setup, add two scripts in `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon --config nodemon.json src/index.ts",
    "dev:debug": "nodemon --config nodemon.json --inspect-brk src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

Note the `dev:debug` script adds `--inspect-brk` flag, this tells node to halt the program execution until the debugger is attached, this can be replaced with
`--inspect` flag to debug without halting.

Now we can run our program with npm run dev, try to change something the see the program re runs with the updated code!

## Debugging with VSCode

The last piece in this puzzle is adding VSCode debugging configuration.

Create `.vscode/launch.json` file containing the following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach",
      "restart": true,
      "processId": "${command:PickProcess}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now when we launch nodemon by `npm run dev:debug` and the program halts until we attached to it:

<Image
  src="/assets/blog/typescript-and-nodemon-the-ultimate-setup/attach.jpg"
  alt="VSCode attachment"
  width={1000}
  height={111}
/>

After attaching the VSCode will stop on the first line of code and you can easily debug your program!
