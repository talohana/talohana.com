One of the core principals of TypeScript is that it is a Structural Type System.
Simply put, TypeScript is fine with having extra properties as long as you provide a type with its' required properties, let's look at an example:

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

const meaningfulPoint = {
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
  meaningOfLife: 42,
}; // Type is { x: number, y: number, meaningOfLife: number }

const point: Point = meaningfulPoint; // OK - Structural Typing Works
```

But when we try to assign the object literal directly:

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

const point: Point = { x: 1, y: 2, meaningOfLife: 42 }; // ERROR
```

And we get the following (and a little surprising) error:

```text
Type '{ x: number; y: number; meaningOfLife: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Point'.
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'meaningOfLife' does not exist
in type 'Point'.
```

When TypeScript encounters object literal in assignments or when passed as an argument to functions it triggers an action called **excess property checking.**

In contrary to structural typing,
it check whether the object has the exact properties.
As mentioned, the same is with object literals passed as an argument to functions:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

function sayMyName(person: Person): void {
  console.log('My name is ', person.name);
}

const personWithAge = { name: 'Tal', age: 23 };

sayMyName(personWithAge); // OK - Structural Typing Works
sayMyName({ name: 'Tal', age: 23 });
// ERROR:
// argument of type { name: string, age: number }
// is not assignable to parameter of type 'Person'.
```

One interesting behavior is with **“Weak Types”** — types which all their fields are marked as Optional.
In this case the excess property checking action takes place even when assigning intermediate variable:

```ts
interface WeakPoint {
  x?: number;
  y?: number;
}

const meaningfulWeakPoint = { meaningOfLife: 42 };

const point: WeakPoint = meaningfulWeakPoint;
// ERROR:
// Type { meaningOfLife: number } has no
// properties in common with Type 'WeakPoint'.
```

## Workarounds

We can, **although not recommended**, workaround the excess property checking.
The first way to do so is to use intermediate variable, this works since you first assign the object literal to an un-typed variable,
and then the second assignment does not undergoes the excess property checking:

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

const intermediate = { x: 1, y: 2, meaningOfLife: 42 };
const point: Point = intermediate; // OK - Structural Typing Works
```

The second way is to use type assertions:

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

const point: Point = { x: 1, y: 2, meaningOfLife: 42 } as Point; // OK - Type Assertion
```
